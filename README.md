# python-api-challenge
This challenge involved creating a Python script to visualize weather data for over 500 cities at varying distances from the equator. I utilized the citipy Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and applied problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities. I have successfully completed all the tasks outlined in the Python API Challenge. The challenge provided valuable experience in utilizing APIs, data visualization, and geographical data processing. I am pleased with the outcome and look forward to applying these skills in future projects.
